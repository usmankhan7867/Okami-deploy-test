## Troubleshooting

### ReferenceError: Can't find variable: BigInt using React

Occasionally, users encounter errors in web3.js due to external dependencies, which may seem challenging to resolve within the web3.js framework alone.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Install `rn-nodeify` as a development dependency:
```bash
yarn add --dev rn-nodeify
```

2. Add the `big-integer` package:
```bash
yarn add big-integer
```

3. Create a file named `shim.js` at the root of your project and include the following polyfill:
```ts
if (typeof BigInt === 'undefined') {
    global.BigInt = require('big-integer');
}
```

4. Import shim.js at the top of your App.js:
```ts
// Make sure you use `import` and not `require`!
import './shim.js'
```
