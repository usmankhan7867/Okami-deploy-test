## [4.0.0-alpha.1]

### Breaking Changes

#### Connection close is not supported

In `1.x` user had access to raw connection object and can interact with it. e.g.

```ts
web3.currentProvider.connection.close();
```

But this internal behavior is not exposed any further. Though you can achieve same with this approach.

```ts
web3.currentProvider.disconnect();
```
